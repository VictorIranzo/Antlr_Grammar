# SDM_TryToMeet
An ANTLR grammar and some other staff to create a desginer for Business Rules.

# Introduction
This repository contains some prototypes to develop a desginer for Business Rules using ANTLR grammars. The idea comes from the post of [Federico Tomassetti](https://tomassetti.me/autocompletion-editor-antlr) - "Building autocompletion for an editor based on ANTLR". Also thanks to the repository of [Oran Epelbaum
](https://github.com/oranoran/antlr4-autosuggest), whose idea developed in Java is invoked from C# code.
