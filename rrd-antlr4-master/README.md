# RRD for ANTLR4

Railroad Diagrams for ANTLR 4 grammar rules.

I won't be adding new features to this tool. If you're looking for a 
more fully featured tool (including LaTeX output, to name just one thing),
and a more modular setup version of this tool, have a look at flashpixx' 
RRD-ANTLR4: https://github.com/flashpixx/RRD-ANTLR4

## Introduction

This tool parses ANTLR 4 grammars and creates an html page containing
all parser- and lexer rules from this grammar with accompanying railroad
diagrams as well as creating separate railroad PNG images of all grammar
rules.

## Install

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/bkiers/rrd-antlr4.git
```

Then build it:

```
cd rrd-antlr4
mvn clean package
```

The JAR file containing all dependencies can be found in the `target` folder.

To give it a test by parsing the JSON grammar found in the official ANTLR 4
repository, run the following command from the terminal:

```
cd target
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antlr/grammars-v4/master/json/JSON.g4
java -jar rrd-antlr4-0.1.2.jar JSON.g4
```

When the command above finishes, one html and pdf file and some png images
will have been generated in the folder `./output/JSON`. The html file
does not make use of the png files but uses SVG to display the railroad
diagram and will look like this:

![json diagrams](https://raw.github.com/bkiers/rrd-antlr4/master/static/json.png)

## Using programmatically

To use this library in your own code, either stick the JAR file
(rrd-antlr4-0.1.2.jar) in your classpath, or add the following
dependency to your POM (after having done a `mvn clean package`!):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>nl.big-o</groupId>
    <artifactId>rrd-antlr4</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.2</version>
</dependency>
```

and parse a grammar file as follows:

```java
String grammarFileName = "/path/to/Json.g4";
DiagramGenerator generator = new DiagramGenerator(grammarFileName);

// Print all parsed rules
System.out.println("all parsed rules: " + generator.getRules().keySet());

// The name of the rule to create a railroad diagram of
String ruleName = "jsonObject";

// Get the SVG of the rule
String svg = generator.getSVG(ruleName);
System.out.println("the svg looks like this: " + svg);

// Create the PNG railroad diagram
boolean success = generator.createDiagram(ruleName);
System.out.println("successfully created diagram: " + success);

// Create an html file containing all rules
success = generator.createHtml("/path/to/file.html");
System.out.println("successfully created the html file: " + success);
```
